TFC Seed Maker
==============

Purpose
-------

There are 2 main reasons I'm making this:

1. I wanted to be able to check one or more existing seeds for resoureces and/or make maps of those resources.
2. I wanted to make a non-spoiling way to select a good seed. (aka be sure it has some decent resources within a reasonable radius of spawn, without knowing where to go look)
